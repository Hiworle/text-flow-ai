# TextFlowAi

A powerful and flexible text processing tool powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool allows users to input example text and rule-based prompts, generating output in a specified format. Ideal for automating text transformations, format conversions, and content generation tasks.

## Features
- **Dynamic Rule Parsing**: Define custom rules to process text dynamically.
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage AI models (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for intelligent text processing.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new rules and adapt to diverse use cases.
- **User-Friendly API**: Simple RESTful API for seamless integration into workflows.

## Use Cases
- Format conversions (e.g., date, time, or text styles).
- Content extraction and summarization.
- Custom text generation based on user-defined templates.

Built with **Go** for high performance and scalability, this project is perfect for developers and teams looking to automate and enhance text processing tasks with the power of AI.
